# TRYPSY WEBSITE

# ------------------------- intro summary 
This is a 4 page website built for assesment by CI Dublin following modules in HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Dev. The website is incomplete, due to the specifications of the project: 'Create a website of around 4-5 pages'. The full design can be viewed in the wireframe attached in the folder. Meanwhile, what I have built for this project encapsulates the most important aspect of the website's design: a 3-option navigation system. 

The website I have chosen to design is for an up-and-coming band called 'Trypsy'. I have centered the main functionality of this website around a '3-option nav' system, instead of the traditional landing page with muitple option navigation. The purpose of this is to assist the customer in accessing the information they want as quickly as possible. A customer who has to search too much to find what they need is an unhappy customer. The best website will accurately predict usage trends and cater design to those predictions. Therefore, the 3 option nav predicts the 3 main uses for a up-and-coming band website; 1. listening to music, 2. finding gigs, and 3. booking the band. 

If this were a website for a high-cost commercial band who successfully sell high quantities of merch, then I would substitute the bookings button with a shop button within the confines of the 3-option nav system. 

# ------------------------- user stories 
    1) As a music lover, I want to find gigs in my local area, so I can see and hear my favourite music live.
    2) As a music lover, I want to find my favourite band's soundcloud or spotify account, so I access and share their music.
    3) As an artist booker, I want to be able to access booking information quickly, so that I can do my job well. 
    4) As an artist booker, I want to be impressed by the layout and quality of a band's website, so I can feel confident that I'm working with professionals.  

# FEATURES
# ------------------------- existing features
    1) 3-option navigation; provides the user with quick access to information 
    2) Nice clean layout using bootstraps grid system
    3) Simple use of css effects to guide users to click on buttons. 
        i) such as hover color change on social media links. (these links do not currently redirect to a social media site. The band is a fantasy band, and so the sites do not exist). 
        ii) hover sweep-to-bottom on the 3 option nav buttons as they appear throughout the 3 specified pages.
    4) Responsivity using bootstraps grid system. The site is largely responsive across devices (testing using the 'chameleon' plugin and 'Emmet Re:View').

# ------------------------- non-existing features
    1) Social media links are not hooked up to social media pages. 
    2) The booking form is frontend only
    3) The gigs displayed on the gigs page would have to be entered manually as html, and of course this isn't the best approach. It would be far better to have all listed gigs stored in a database, automatically being revealed and hidden depending on the gig date. 
    4) Some webpages have been omitted due to time constraints. The website's full design can be seen in the wireframe. 
    5) The buttons displayed on the listen page for 'share', 'add to playlist', and 'download' are frontend only. The functionality required to build these was not required within the context of this project. 
    
# A Note on Content & Minimalism
 I've often seen overpopulated content areas, which in my opinion is a disadvantage to good UX. I prefer  to use visual guides e.g video, photo, css tricks, colors, animations, tooltips & icons where possible to inform a user about functionality and content. This website therefore shows only necessary information, concisely and cleanly. 

# TECHNOLOGY USED
    1) This site was built using the scripting language HTML5, styling with CSS, and simple logic with JS for side bar navigation. 
    
    2) Bootstrap Responsive Grid System provided a great solution for clean styling and layout: 
    https://getbootstrap.com/
    
    3) Fonts were sourced from Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/. Many fonts are already cauched in user browsers helping with page load time!
    
    4) Font Awesome Icons provided a great selection of free icons https://fontawesome.com/
    
    5) The hover style used throughout was sourced from cloudflare by open-source author-developer Ian Lunn
